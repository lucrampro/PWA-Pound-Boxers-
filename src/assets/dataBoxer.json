Ali was stripped of his heavyweight title and did not fight for four years as a result.</p><p class=\"\">Ali is known for his trilogy with Joe Frazier, losing the first but winning the next two, and for utilizing his famed \"rope-a-dope\" style to upset George Foreman in the Congo in 1974 to regain his titles.</p><p class=\"\">The tactic caused Foreman to expend tremendous energy firing punches in Ali's guard. Most of the shots were deflected or blocked and led to Ali stopping an exhausted Foreman in the eighth round.</p><p class=\"\">In his illustrious career, Ali also holds victories over Bob Foster, Ken Norton, Jimmy Ellis and Floyd Patterson.

When he returned, he once again captured the middleweight title, something he'd do five times in his illustrious career.</p><p class=\"\">Reading Sugar Ray Robinson's record, you'd think you stumbled into a who's who of fighters during this era. And this era was on par with, and probably superior to, any in boxing history.</p><p class=\"\">He fought, and beat, literally everyone.</p><p class=\"\">Jake LaMotta, Carmen Basilio, Gene Fullmer, Randy Turpin, Carl \"Bobo\" Olson, Henry Armstrong, Rocky Graziano, Kid Gavilan.</p><p class=\"\">Robinson beat them all, and he did it with speed, a tremendous jab and power in both hands.
