    <h1 class="title_boxeur">Mike Tyson</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle_carrer">HIS CARRER</h2>
    <p>Record: 44-1-1, 32 KO</p>
    <p>Years Active: 1975-1982</p>
    <p>Championships: WBC Featherweight</p>
    <p>
      If not for his tragic death in an automobile accident in 1982, many boxing
      observers feel that Salvador Sanchez may well have become the greatest
      featherweight fighter of all time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his short but impressive career, Sanchez compiled wins over high-level
      opposition, including Danny "Little Red" Lopez twice, Ruben Castillo, Juan
      Laporte, Wilfredo Gomez and Azumah Nelson.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's unfortunate that we never got a chance to see how great he could have
      truly been.
